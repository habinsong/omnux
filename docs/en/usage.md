For a fresh checkout, run `./scripts/omnux setup` before starting the dashboard. It checks or installs dependencies, builds the core and middleware, runs `npm test`, and registers the launcher.

## Chat

Chat supports single model, orchestration, multi-LLM comparison, Think+, URL/search/memory context, sticky skills, and TTS. Active skills also apply to URL and web-search requests instead of being bypassed by fast paths.

## Coding

Coding runs create real folders, files, commands, stdout/stderr, validation status, and recoverable recent-result snapshots.

Coding uses the same skill selection model as Chat. If the UI dropdown selects one skill but the prompt explicitly names another, the prompt wins.

## Routines and Logic

Routines handle natural-language creation, immediate runs, scheduled runs, browser-agent runs, and Telegram delivery.

The routine overview keeps refresh/sync actions aligned with the status summary on the same row when width allows.

![Logic tab](../assets/readme/dashboard-logic-tab.png)

Logic graphs connect chat, coding, routines, and tools on a node canvas.

Remote limited mode blocks logic graph execution actions. Local authenticated clients can still list, edit, run, cancel, and inspect logic graph results.

## Settings and Remote Access

Remote clients enter limited mode without an OTP prompt. Limited mode allows read-oriented views, routing policy changes, and model selection. Chat, coding, routine, logic graph, task, refactor, and tool execution actions are blocked along with OTP/CLI auth, Telegram/LLM keys, and external-access toggle changes.

## Notebooks and Plans

![Notebooks tab](../assets/readme/dashboard-notebooks-tab.png)

Notebooks keep learnings, decisions, verification notes, and handoff documents. Plans turn larger work into reviewed and executable task graphs.
